# Astro Blog

We are builing a blog site following the [Build a Blog](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) tutorial at the astro docs website.

Things we'll learn about:

- Set up our development environment
- Create pages and blog posts for our website
- Build with Astro components
- Query and work with local files
- Add interactivity to our site
- Deploy our site to the web

We can see the [Blog Tutorial Demo](https://stackblitz.com/github/withastro/blog-tutorial-demo/tree/complete?file=src%2Fpages%2Findex.astro).

The repository for this tutorial is [astro-blog](https://github.com/pan-arcadia/astro-blog).
